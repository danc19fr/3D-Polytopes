# 3D-Polytopes

Years ago I read about hypercubes and wondered what one would look like. Turn it around in all axes. Project it into 3 dimensions. See what it looks like. I made a Basic program to do it on an Atari 800 which was fascinating (to me, at least). This is intended to be a modern version, using better graphics, to run on and Android phone or tablet. Simple geometric objects, convex regular polytopes, will be represented in 2- to 6-dimensional space. Each polytope will be an object containing arrays that define vertices, edges, and faces. The object can be rotated about any pair of axes, except x and y, which are already fully displayed. The object is then orthogonally projected into 3-dimensional space, and rendered on the 2-dimensional screen for 3D viewing, using anaglyph, parallel, or cross-eye representations. The app will be open-sourced and the user is encouraged to add new objects.
